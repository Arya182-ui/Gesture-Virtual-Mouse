# ü§ñ Gesture Controlled Virtual Mouse

A smart and intuitive **gesture-based control system** built using **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **Python**, designed to make human-computer interaction seamless and futuristic! This project allows you to control your computer with hand gestures for tasks like launching apps, drawing, and mouse control ‚Äî no touch required!

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ **Gesture-based Mouse Control**
‚úÖ **Right & Left Click with Gestures**
‚úÖ **Launch Any App Using Double Click**
‚úÖ **Real-time Hand Tracking with MediaPipe**
‚úÖ **Lightweight GUI (Tkinter / PyQt)**
‚úÖ **Smooth User Experience with High Accuracy**

## üß† Tech Stack

* **Python** üêç
* **OpenCV** ‚Äì For video capture & image processing
* **MediaPipe** ‚Äì Real-time hand detection
* **PyAutoGUI** ‚Äì For controlling the mouse and keyboard
* **Tkinter / PyQt** ‚Äì For building GUI
* **OS Module** ‚Äì To launch system apps
* **Custom Gesture Mapping Engine** ‚Äì Map specific hand gestures to actions

## üñêÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Track Hand Gestures in Real Time** using MediaPipe.
2. **Interpret Gestures** like finger position, hand shape, and distance.
3. **Map Gestures to Actions** like cursor movement, click, app launch, or drawing.
4. **Execute Actions** using PyAutoGUI or OS commands.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Gesture-Controlled-Virtual-Mouse.git
cd Gesture-Virtual-Mouse

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python gesture_gui.py
```
## If you don't want use GUI 
```bash
# Run this
python Gesture_Controller.py
```

## ü§Ø Future Improvements
